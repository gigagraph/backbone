cd jj
git checkout "${JJ_VERSION}"
```

Run the following command to build release distribution and install it:

cargo install --all-features --locked --bin jj jj-cli
```

Run jj to install the manpages:

```bash
sudo "$(which jj)" util install-man-pages /usr/local/share/man
```

[User's `jj` configuration should reside in `jj config path --user`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt---global).
